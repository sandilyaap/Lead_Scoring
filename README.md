To build a Logistic Regression Model to predict whether a lead online courses for an education company named X education would successfully converted or Notâ€¦
To help X Education to select the most promising leads ( Hot Leads), these are most likely to convert into paying customers
To build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score value between 0 to 100 each of the values can be used by the company to target potential leads

The objective is classified into sub - goals observe below:
1. Create a logistic regression model to Predict the lead conversion probabilities for each lead.
2. Decide on a Probability threshold value above which a lead will be predicted as converted whereas not converted if it is below it..
3. Multiply the lead conversion probability to arrive at the lead score value of each lead.
